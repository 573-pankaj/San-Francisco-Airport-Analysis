# Airport Analysis

Developed Airport and Airline data analysis dashboard .






## Acknowledgements

 Airport data analytics for San Francisco help to unleash
key information and knowledge that willhelp to address 
many of the key areas where airports face challenges. 
These areas extend to almost every facet of airport 
processes, from purely operational ones â€“ such as airport 
resource usage optimization, maintenance, and airport 
capacity â€“ to nonâ€“aeronautical revenue intensification
and passenger experience maximization.



## Problem Statement 
Prepare a project to identify where the various flights are going and what will be the busiest and most lengthy routes from the airport. Also, create a hidden filter within the dashboard.
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes.
## About Data

For this project, we used data from the San Francisco Airport for March 2020. To proceed we have taken the important aspects like Coordinates, Route, Date, Base Airline, Terminal (Gate No.), Actual time, and Estimated time. In order to get data for the Airport and Airlines we have added the dataset for Airport information (City, IATA, Country, Name, Code). Using this information, we have figured most common destinations that were frequent from San Francisco, the busiest route covered along with the distance covered during those flights.
